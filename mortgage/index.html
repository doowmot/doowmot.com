  <h1>I Left Financial Advice for Software Engineering Because the Tools Were Broken</h1>
    <p><a href="/" class="back-link">Back</a></p>

  <p>I recently had a routine consultation with my doctor and during that 10-minute conversation, he penned a small novel. As I was leaving, he plucked his smouldering hands up from the keyboard and gave me a dazed look. I knew that look, I was a mortgage advisor - I'd felt that too.</p>

  <p>A mortgage advisor is a challenging job. You're an advisor, confidant, consigliere, friend and open ear. Your job is to listen, ask good questions, communicate well and be a proactive problem-solver. Every day, you traverse an imagined future with your client, holding their hand, joyfully plotting the trail of what their future may look like. There's a lot to remember.</p>

  <p>This becomes more difficult when you can feel the warm, anxious breath of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) down your spine. The FCA are like insecure ex-partner. You're constantly looking over your shoulder, having to justify yourself. Why did you recommend this and not that...? To the consumer, the FCA is a blessing; to the ethical advisor, a curse.</p>

  <p>The brokerage I worked for, one of the largest in the UK, were were using internal systems that even the Soviet Union would have been embarrassed by. We used a proprierty crm that was likely built 20 years ago, and last updated 10 years ago. It was now "too difficult to change".</p>

  <p>I thought technology was supposed to help us, liberate us. Instead it feels like it's imprisoned us.</p>

  <p>So, these two things, FCA regulations, that didn't fit with existing workflows, and horrific internal systems, have forced me to fix it myself. So I embarked upon becoming a software engineer. I chose the Makers Academy bootcamp to get me started, as I wanted to move at pace. I'm now building mortgage tools to help simplify the process.</p>

  <p>My job always was, and still is to solve problems. The medium has changed from giving personal mortgage advice, to building and maintaining systems that liberate us instead of imprisoning us.</p>
