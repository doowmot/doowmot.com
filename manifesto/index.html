  <h1>A Junior Software Engineer's Manifesto</h1>
    <p><a href="/" class="back-link">Back</a></p>

  <p>I recognise the potential hubris in writing a manifesto as a junior engineer, but I'm masochistic enough to enjoy the exercise anyway:</p>

  <h2 class="post-heading">1. I don't have all the answersâ€”but I will find them.</h2>
  <p>I'm not yet an expert programmer. But I learn quickly, ask good questions, break problems down, and persist until I find solutions.</p>

  <h2 class="post-heading">2. Technologies will change, meta-skills won't.</h2>
  <p>Problem-solving, resilience, communication, adaptability, and self-learning are the foundations of my career. Coding is the cherry on top.</p>

  <h2 class="post-heading">3. You're hiring me to solve problems.</h2>
  <p>Code is one of the tools I use to solve problems. Other tools include: domain knowledge, communication skills, enthusiasm and work-ethic.</p>

  <h2 class="post-heading">4. User needs come first.</h2>
  <p>I'm not a luddite, I love technology too! But, I'm going to commit heresy: all technologies (including LLMs), should be judged by how well they solve user needs. Simplicity before complexity.</p>

  <h2 class="post-heading">5. Here's things I recognise.</h2>
  <p>I'll read more code than I write. Great software is built and maintained by teams, not individuals. Engineering is more than syntax. It's requirements, maintainability, security, and performance. I don't understand all these nuances, but I approach it with a systems mindset.</p>

  <p>The tools will differ and the landscape will shift. But the ability to think clearly, adapt to new information, communicate well and proactively solve problems won't change. That's what you're hiring me for. I'll pickup the nuances of programming along the way.</p>
